# 🚀 Deployment Checklist

## Problem You're Facing
```
❌ "Network error - please check if the server is running"
```

**Why?** GitHub Pages can't run Python servers!

---

## ✅ Solution Checklist

### [ ] Step 1: Sign Up for Render.com
- Go to https://render.com
- Click "Get Started for Free"
- Sign up with GitHub account
- **Time: 2 minutes**

### [ ] Step 2: Deploy Backend
- Click "New +" → "Web Service"
- Connect GitHub repository: `iwtbg-8/iwtbg`
- Fill in:
  - **Name**: `iwtbg-backend` (or any name)
  - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - **Start Command**: `python server_production.py`
  - **Instance Type**: Free
- Click "Create Web Service"
- **Time: 5-10 minutes to deploy**
- ✍️ **Write down your Render URL**: `https://__________.onrender.com`

### [ ] Step 3: Update Frontend Code
- Open `script.js` in your code editor
- Find lines 6-8 (the API_URL section)
- Change from:
  ```javascript
  : 'http://localhost:5000';
  ```
  to:
  ```javascript
  : 'https://YOUR-RENDER-URL.onrender.com';
  ```
- Replace `YOUR-RENDER-URL` with your actual Render URL from Step 2
- **Time: 1 minute**

### [ ] Step 4: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add script.js server.py server_production.py render.yaml
git commit -m "Deploy to production"
git push origin main
```
- **Time: 1 minute**

### [ ] Step 5: Wait for Deployments
- GitHub Pages: Auto-rebuilds in 2-3 minutes
- Render: Auto-redeploys when you push
- **Time: 3-5 minutes**

### [ ] Step 6: Test Backend
Open terminal and run:
```bash
curl https://YOUR-RENDER-URL.onrender.com/api
```
✅ Should return JSON with API info  
❌ If error, wait 2 more minutes and try again

### [ ] Step 7: Test Frontend
- Visit: `https://iwtbg-8.github.io/iwtbg/`
- Paste a video URL (try: `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ`)
- Click "Download"
- **First time**: Wait 30-60 seconds (backend waking up from free tier sleep)
- ✅ Should show video info and download button

### [ ] Step 8: Verify It's Working
- Try downloading a video
- Check it downloads successfully
- Try with different video URLs

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You know it's working when:
- ✅ No "Network error" message
- ✅ Video thumbnail and info appear
- ✅ Download button is clickable
- ✅ Video downloads to your computer

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

| Problem | Check This | Solution |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Network error | Backend URL in script.js | Update to your Render URL |
| Still network error | Backend running? | Visit Render URL directly |
| 30-60 second wait | Normal on free tier | Wait or upgrade ($7/mo) |
| CORS error | Server.py CORS setting | Already fixed in updated files |
| Backend won't start | Render logs | Check Dashboard → Logs |
| GitHub Pages not updating | Wait longer | Takes 2-3 min to rebuild |

## ⏱️ Total Time Estimate

- Setup Render account: 2 min
- Deploy backend: 5-10 min
- Update code: 1 min

## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment

1. ✅ Get it working (this checklist)
2. Test with various video sites
3. Add authentication (before making public!)
4. Add rate limiting (prevent abuse)
5. Consider paid plan if you want 24/7 uptime
6. Share with friends (carefully!)

## ✨ You're Almost There!

The solution is simple:
1. Backend → Render.com (free)
2. Frontend → GitHub Pages (already done)
3. Update API URL in script.js
4. Push and test

**Just 3 steps and 15 minutes!** 🚀

Good luck! 🎉
