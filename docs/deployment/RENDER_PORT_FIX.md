# ✅ Fixed: Render.com Port Binding Issue

## Problem
```
Port scan timeout reached, failed to detect open port 10000 from PORT environment variable.
```

## Root Cause
Render.com automatically sets the `PORT` environment variable to **10000**, but:
1. Our `render.yaml` was overriding it to 5500
2. The server wasn't explicitly using Render's PORT value

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated `server_production.py`
```python
# OLD: Default to 5500
port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5500))

# NEW: Default to 10000 (Render's expected port)
port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 10000))
```

Also added:
- ✅ Debug logging to show PORT environment variable
- ✅ Error handling for server startup
- ✅ Auto-create downloads directory
- ✅ More verbose logging

### 2. Updated `render.yaml`
```yaml
# REMOVED these lines (they were conflicting):
envVars:
  - key: PORT
    value: 5500  # ❌ This was overriding Render's auto PORT
```

Now Render uses its default PORT (10000) without conflicts.

### 3. Already Updated `script.js`
```javascript
// Frontend now points to your Render deployment
const API_URL = 'https://iwtbg.onrender.com';
```

## What Happens Now

1. **Render Auto-Redeploys** (2-5 minutes)
   - Detects the git push
   - Rebuilds with new code
   - Server will bind to port 10000 correctly

2. **GitHub Pages Updates** (2-3 minutes)
   - Frontend gets the new script.js
   - API calls go to https://iwtbg.onrender.com

## Testing

### Wait 5 minutes, then test:

**1. Test Backend:**
```bash
curl https://iwtbg.onrender.com/api
```
Should return JSON with API info.

**2. Test Frontend:**
Visit: `https://iwtbg-8.github.io/iwtbg/`
- Should no longer show "Network error"
- Try downloading a video

**3. Check Render Logs:**
Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
- Click on your service
- View logs - should show:
  ```
  🔍 Binding to port: 10000
  ✨ Starting Waitress server on 0.0.0.0:10000
  ```

## Why Port 10000?

Render.com's web services:
- Always bind to `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces)
- Use the PORT environment variable (Render sets this to 10000)
- Health checks ping this port to verify service is up

**You don't need to configure the port manually** - Render handles it automatically.

## Current Status

✅ Code pushed to GitHub (commit: 22fc087)  
⏳ Render redeploying (wait 2-5 minutes)  
⏳ GitHub Pages updating (wait 2-3 minutes)  

## Next Steps

1. ⏳ **Wait 5 minutes** for both deployments to complete
2. ✅ **Test backend**: `curl https://iwtbg.onrender.com/api`
3. ✅ **Test frontend**: Visit your GitHub Pages URL
4. ✅ **Try downloading** a video to confirm everything works
5. 🎉 **Celebrate!** Your app is live!

## If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check Render Logs
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click on "iwtbg" (or your service name)
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for:
   - ✅ "Binding to port: 10000"
   - ✅ "Starting Waitress server"
   - ❌ Any error messages

### Common Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError"**
- Fix: Check requirements.txt has all dependencies
- Run: `pip freeze > requirements.txt` locally and push

**"Still shows port 5500 in logs"**
- Fix: Wait for redeploy to finish (check Render dashboard)
- Clear build cache in Render if needed

**"Backend returns 502/503"**
- Cause: Service is still starting (takes 30-60 seconds first time)
- Fix: Wait and retry

**"CORS error in browser"**
- Check: `server.py` has your GitHub Pages URL in CORS origins
- Already fixed in previous commits

## Monitoring

After deployment, check:
- ✅ Render Dashboard shows "Live" status (green)
- ✅ Logs show "Starting Waitress server on 0.0.0.0:10000"
- ✅ `/api` endpoint returns JSON
- ✅ Frontend can connect and download videos

## Free Tier Reminder

⚠️ **Render Free Tier:**
- Service sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request takes 30-60 seconds to wake up
- This is normal behavior

**To get 24/7 uptime:**
- Upgrade to Render Starter ($7/month)
- Or use a ping service like UptimeRobot

**Status:** Changes pushed, waiting for Render to redeploy ⏳

**ETA:** ~5 minutes until live 🚀
